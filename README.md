My newest project. The idea is to automatically download all papers from the danish grocers then save all these products in a database and allow users to sort on a lot of metrics, including any macro/100g, biggest discount, biggest discount over time(ignores base price of product) and many more! The website will also allow users to get notified when specific items go below a certain price.
